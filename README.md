# Master_Project-SDF-
This is part of the code for Geodetic Engineering Master Project
Make sure that you are running this projetc under the root of "Alpha_Test", otherwise there might be problem and you have to reset the path by your self
The out put of the mian.py file are the samples (Q_w,you should see it's shape) and the corresponding distance(sample_distance, which is not psdf yet) and also,coords_n and psdf are the data for training(not torch data yet, but I wrote code to turn it into torch as you should see down there)
For anyquestion, feel free to ask me. And if there's problem or I did anything wrong, please let me know
